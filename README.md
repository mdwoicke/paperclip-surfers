## What's new in V2

[Paperclip](https://github.com/paperclipai/paperclip) is an open-source control plane for AI agent companies. This fork adds:

### Persistent Conversations
Agents resume the same Claude Code conversation across all tasks within a project — no more starting fresh every run. Comments on tasks, new assignments, and wakeups all continue the same session.

### Agent Memory
Agents accumulate knowledge that persists across sessions:
- **Global memory** — cross-project learnings, CEO/board feedback, preferences
- **Project memory** — codebase patterns, team preferences, prior decisions
- Memory is automatically injected into every agent run as system prompt context

### MCP Integration
- **Sync from Claude Code** — discovers MCP servers you've already configured in `~/.claude.json` (one click)
- **Per-agent assignment** — assign specific MCPs to specific agents (CEO gets Slack, DevOps gets AWS)
- **Company defaults** — set MCPs for all agents, with per-agent overrides
- At runtime, `--mcp-config` is automatically passed to the Claude CLI

### Skills Selector
- User-installed skills from `~/.claude/skills` are now selectable per agent
- Checkbox UI in agent settings — toggle skills on/off per agent
- Selected skills are symlinked into the agent's execution directory at runtime

### Self-Improvement Loop
- **Post-run KPIs** — every run records: completion status, tokens, cost, duration, errors
- **Observations** — CEO agent or board humans log patterns they notice over time
- **Experiments** — opt-in A/B testing of approaches per agent
- **Analytics page** — company-wide performance trends across all agents
